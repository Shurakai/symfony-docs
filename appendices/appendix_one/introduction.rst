   single: Appendix One, Introduction


What's this about?
==================

Within the book you have learned about the features of Symfony2
and where you might use them.
The cookbook, on the other hand, tells you about approved best practices
you will need when implementing features in your application.

Symfony2 ships with a so-called ``Dependency Injection Container``, which
actually is the heart of the Symfony2 Framework.

There are many reasons why you will want to use the container yourself,
however, there might be several stumbling-stones you are not aware of
when learning about this exciting new feature.

This appendix is supposed to point out to you

    1. Which benefits a DIC has and why you should use it
    2. What might change for you when programming
    3. Some general patterns that you should make use of as well as
    4. Which anti-patterns you should be aware of

Since texts and videos on most of the topics covered here is already available
on the web, we will also provide links for further reading so you can deepen
your understanding.
